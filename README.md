    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
    Through the use of of both static and dynamic testing, I can make sure that my program
    is functional and secure. Code reviews, and testing software or plug-ins such as JUnit 
    will ensure that my code is runnig properly. Additionally, understanding code coverage
    is another area that should be focused on when testing code. Code coverages ensures that 
    we are testing the full spectrum of our code. This helps with removing redundancies that 
    may be present within our program.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
    Understanding the user needs is the most vital portion of any project. Testing how a 
    user will use the program is a great way to ensure that we are meeting the needs of 
    the average user. Additionally, the client requirements are generally based on what they 
    expect thier users to use their program for. If the project requirments are met we can
    ensure that the needs of the user will be met. We contantly have to test new additions
    to the program for quality. Testing the program through things like JUnit test gives us 
    as developers the ability to simulate what a live user would do with the program. This can
    help us see flaws in the logic of the program. Even if the code is written with no errors
    the functionality of the program could be flawed. Unit testing helps to minimize those flaws and 
    ensure user needs are met.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    
    For me software design comes down to how the user will enteract with the program.
    I have to ensure that the program makes sense to use. In other words, how would one
    use this program. From their code execution is the next vital step. Writting good error
    free code is an area that I tend to focus on. Syntax is important to error mitigation. Lastly, 
    testing the code functionality has become something I have seen myself do much more often. 
    Utilizing testing tools to help find unforseen errors in the codes execution has been something I
    try to put more focus on. All of these combined ensures that my program will function properly and 
    have a useful UI and UX.
