    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
    Through the use of of both static and dynamic testing, I can make sure that my program
    is functional and secure. Code reviews, and testing software or plug-ins such as JUnit 
    will ensure that my code is runnig properly. Additionally, understanding code coverage
    is another area that should be focused on when testing code. Code coverages ensures that 
    we are testing the full spectrum of our code. This helps with removing redundancies that 
    may be present within our program.
